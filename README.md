# updateObjectValues.js

Input is a two-level nested object with values of all keys at all levels set to "" (a blank string). Output is another object, same level of nesting, with all values at all levels set to another string (or--as I used it--as to a class instantiation, etc.) 

I built this for a specific purpose, for a much larger project. 

This can/should probably be refactored to allow for it to work beyond two levels of nesting. Perhaps this could be accomplished via recursion, or perhaps via a wrapper for loop.
